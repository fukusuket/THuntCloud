# DU-15: Explicitly register the DuckDB SQLAlchemy dialect under all lookup keys.
#
# SQLAlchemy 2.x normalizes the URI driver separator when resolving dialects:
#   URI "duckdb+duckdb_engine://"  →  registry lookup key "duckdb.duckdb_engine"
#   URI "duckdb://"                →  registry lookup key "duckdb"
#
# Without explicit registration both lookups fall through to importlib.metadata
# entry-point discovery, which can silently fail in Superset 6.x, producing:
#   Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:duckdb.duckdb_engine
#
# We register both keys so either URI form works regardless of entry-point state.
