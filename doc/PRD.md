# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## THuntCloud - AWS Log Threat Hunting Tool

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Document Version | 0.1 (Draft) |
| Date | 2026-03-10 |
| Status | Under Review |

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This product is a locally-executed threat hunting tool targeting AWS logs, primarily CloudTrail. By combining AI-Agent-assisted analysis with a built-in dashboard — without requiring logs to be ingested into a SIEM — it enables security analysts who lack deep AWS log expertise to perform fast and effective threat hunting on their own machines.

---

## 2. Background and Problem Statement

### 2.1 Problems to Solve

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Log expertise barrier | Detecting and analyzing threats is difficult without deep knowledge of AWS log formats such as CloudTrail |
| SIEM dependency | Existing threat hunting workflows assume ingestion into a SIEM (Splunk, Elasticsearch, etc.), resulting in high operational costs |
| Scalability gap | Few tools can process tens of gigabytes of logs quickly on a local PC |
| Knowledge silos | Without SQL skills or an understanding of log structure, analysts cannot write custom queries to investigate incidents |

### 2.2 Target Users

- Cloud security analysts (beginner to intermediate AWS log experience)
- Incident responders (requiring rapid initial triage)
- Security engineers (building or evaluating in-house log analysis tooling)

---

## 3. Product Vision and Goals

### 3.1 Vision

> "An open tool that empowers anyone to perform fast, high-precision threat hunting on a local PC — no AWS log expertise required."

### 3.2 Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Ingestion time for 10 GB of logs | Within a few minutes (target: under 5 minutes) |
| Full scan of 50 GB of logs | Completable on a single PC |
| AI-generated SQL adoption rate | 50%+ of analysts execute AI-generated queries without modification |
| Automated threat hunting report generation | One-click output available per investigation session |

---

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope (v1.0)

- Local ingestion of CloudTrail logs (JSON / gz-compressed) and storage in DuckDB
- AI-Agent-assisted SQL query generation, execution, and analysis
- Automated threat hunting report generation
- Built-in dashboard powered by Apache Superset
- Single-command launch via Docker Compose

### 4.2 Out of Scope (v1.0)

- Direct S3 ingestion (deferred to v2+)
- Support for VPC Flow Logs, WAF logs, etc. (future plug-in extension)
- Sigma rule conversion (future)
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping (future)
- SaaS / cloud-hosted deployment

## 11. Open Issues and Decisions

### 11.1 DuckDB Container Sharing Strategy [RESOLVED]

**Decision: Adopt Docker Bind Mount + 1-writer / n-readers architecture**

DuckDB is an in-process database and does not support concurrent writes from multiple processes (a second process attempting to write will fail due to file locking). However, multiple READ_ONLY connections are permitted while one process holds a write lock. Given this constraint, the following architecture is adopted.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Bind Mount: docker/data/db/threat_hunting.db        │
│           Mounted on host NVMe/SSD (recommended)              │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
             │ READ_WRITE (1)          │ READ_ONLY (multiple)
             ▼                         ▼
        ingester             agent / config_viz / dashboard
      (write only)                  (read only)
```

Rationale and technical comparison:

| Option | Performance | Concurrent Access | Implementation Cost | Decision |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------:|
| **Bind Mount + READ_ONLY** | ◎ Near-direct NVMe speed | 1W / nR | Low | **Adopted** |
| Named Volume | ◎ Same as above | Same | Low | Equivalent; bind mount preferred (avoids WSL2 path issues) |
| DuckLake (ducklake extension) | ○ | ◎ Multiple writers | High (requires separate catalog DB) | Consider for v2+ |
| Arrow Flight proxy | △ Network overhead | ◎ | High | Rejected (avoids complexity in v1) |
| NAS / network storage | ✕ Officially discouraged by DuckDB | ✕ | Low | Rejected |

**Implementation guidelines:**
- Each service declares its own `volumes:` entry in `docker-compose.yml` pointing to the host bind-mount path.
- ingester opens the database as `READ_WRITE`; agent, config_viz, and dashboard open as `READ_ONLY`.
- The default flow is sequential: ingester completes ingestion and releases the lock before read-only services start.
- SSD (SATA or NVMe) is strongly recommended for storage; HDD is discouraged (per DuckDB official guidelines).

---

### 11.2 OpenAI API Model Selection [RESOLVED]

**Decision: Adopt `gpt-5.4` as the primary model**
**Configuration guidelines:**
- Default model: `gpt-5.4`
- Model switchable in the UI settings screen
- Future models accommodated via the custom input field

---

### 11.3 Plug-in Interface API Specification [v2.0 DIRECTION RESOLVED]

**Decision: Design a Rust Trait-based plug-in interface in v2.0**

v1.0 will use a fixed CloudTrail implementation. v2.0 will define the following trait as the public API.

```rust
// v2.0 plug-in specification (conceptual design)
pub trait LogIngester: Send + Sync {
    /// Identifier for the log source (e.g., "cloudtrail", "vpc_flowlogs", "waf")
    fn source_id(&self) -> &str;

    /// Receives an input path (local directory or URI) and writes to DuckDB
    fn ingest(&self, input: &IngesterInput, db: &DuckDBHandle) -> Result<IngestStats>;

    /// File extensions / patterns supported by this plug-in
    fn supported_patterns(&self) -> Vec<&str>;
}
```

Built-in plug-in candidates for v2.0:

| Plug-in Name | Target Log | Target Version |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| `cloudtrail` | CloudTrail JSON/gz | v1.0 (fixed) |
| `vpc_flowlogs` | VPC Flow Logs | v2.0 |
| `s3_access` | S3 Access Logs | v2.0 |
| `waf` | AWS WAF Logs | v2.0 |
| `guardduty` | GuardDuty Findings | v2.0 |

---

### 11.4 Superset Initial Dashboard Seeding Strategy [RESOLVED]

**Decision: Auto-import dashboards at container startup using Superset's `import_dashboards` CLI command**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml snippet
superset-init:
  image: apache/superset
  entrypoint: |
    superset import_dashboards -p /app/dashboards/cloudtrail_default.zip
  volumes:
    - ./dashboard/assets:/app/dashboards
```

Dashboard management policy:

| Item | Policy |
|------|--------|
| Dashboard definition file format | Superset export format (ZIP / YAML) |
| Storage location | Repository `dashboard/assets/` directory |
| Update process | Edit in Superset UI → export → overwrite and commit |
| Data source connection | `duckdb:///data/threat_hunting.db` bundled as the default configuration |

---

### 11.5 License Policy [RESOLVED]

**Decision: Release the entire project under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**

Rationale: AGPL-3.0 ensures that any hosted/network-accessible modifications must also be released as open source.

| Component | License | Compatibility |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Rust (language & standard library) | MIT OR Apache 2.0 | ◎ Compatible with AGPL-3.0 |
| DuckDB | MIT | ◎ MIT is compatible with AGPL-3.0 |
| Streamlit | Apache 2.0 | ◎ Apache 2.0 is compatible with AGPL-3.0 |
| Apache Superset | Apache 2.0 | ◎ Compatible |
| Docker Compose | Apache 2.0 | ◎ Compatible |
| OpenAI API client (usage only) | Terms of Service (separate from OSS distribution) | ◎ API usage is outside license scope |
| **This project** | **AGPL-3.0** | ◎ See [LICENSE](../LICENSE) |
